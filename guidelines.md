# Language Pack Submission Policy

Below are the procedures and guidelines that need to be followed by any translator submitting a language pack to our Customisation Database.
All approved language packs can be found in our [Language Packs Database](https://www.phpbb.com/languages/ "Language Packs Database").
If you submit your language pack to our Customisation Database, it will first be automatically sent to the Translations Manager for validation.
He is responsible for ensuring that your submission follows the guidelines below.
Failure to comply with the following instructions could lead to an instant denial of your submission.
Please note the Translations Manager has full discretion on what he approves or denies.
This process can sometimes take a considerable amount of time, so it's in your best interest to follow all of the guidelines from the start.
If your language pack is denied and then resubmitted, it is placed at the end of the queue.

1. Submissions have to be compatible with the latest version of phpBB. Any missing key will be detected during the upload process and your submission will be automatically denied.


2. Submissions have to be complete. Partial translations are not allowed and will be systematically denied. E-mail text files and theme-images must also be fully translated. Only `search_ignore_words.php` and `search_synonyms.php` are allowed to be untranslated. However, they must still be included, have the basic file structure and just an empty array `$words` or `$synonyms` respectively.


3. Language packs can contain five additional files (one mandatory and four optionals) that are not present in the British English language pack: `LICENSE` (mandatory), `README` / `README.md` (optional), `AUTHORS` / `AUTHORS.md` (optional), `VERSION` / `VERSION.md` (optional) and `CHANGELOG` / `CHANGELOG.md` (optional). 
You are free to write whatever you want in the `README` file, you can list all the authors and contributors of your language pack in the `AUTHORS` file, you can put the version of your language pack in the `VERSION` file and you can list all the version history in the `CHANGELOG` file.
Concerning the `LICENSE` file, it is automatically added during the upload process, you do not have to manually add it. It tells to the user the license used.
Language packs inherits phpBB's license [GNU General Public License 2.0](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.php "GNU General Public License 2.0"), and no additional or alternative licenses are allowed.
These files must be placed in the `language/{iso}/` directory, next to the `iso.txt` file. Any other additional file will be detected and your submission will be denied.


4. Submissions must have the following files and structure:

5. Submissions have to follow as much as possible the [3.2 Translation (i18n/L10n) Guidelines](https://area51.phpbb.com/docs/32x/coding-guidelines.html#translation "3.2 Translation (i18n/L10n) Guidelines") recommandantions, especially the [3.2 Writing style](https://area51.phpbb.com/docs/32x/coding-guidelines.html#writingstyle "3.2 Writing style").


6. All the PHP and text files have to be encoding in UTF-8 without BOM and a new line at the end of the file. Many modern text editors use this as a default setting, but we recommend checking it in your editor's settings.
We recommend you [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/ "Notepad++") or [PSPad](http://www.pspad.com/en/ "PSPad"), both lightweight and free.


7. The translation is mostly your work and you have a right to hold a copyright and names to it.


8. A maximum of 3 links can be included as an author credit in the footer, customisable via the `'TRANSLATION_INFO'` key in `common.php`.
Please note that the Translations Manager has complete discretion on what is acceptable as an author credit link.


9. Submissions have to be submitted as a single zip file. For information, the Customisation Database will automatically name `languagename_versionnumber.zip` your uploaded language pack.
For example, if a Brazilian Portuguese language pack author uploads an archive named `Brasileiro_1.0.5.zip`, it will be automatically changed to `brazilian_portuguese_1_0_5.zip`.


10. Contribution description in the Customisation Database should be translated into English in addition of your local language.
Some administrators might want to download your translation without speak your language.


11. Contribution screenshot in the Customisation Database should only be the flag of the country whose the language is spoken.
For example, the flag of France for the French language.


12. Revision name in the Customisation Database should be left blank, contain the phpBB package version and/or package release name (e.g. "**3.0.12 / Richard 'DÂ¡cky' Foote**" for 3.0.12) for more understanding.


13. The Demo URL in the Customisation Database must be empty, unless you want to put a link to an international community ([officially](https://www.phpbb.com/support/intl/ "officially") listed or not) related to the language of the contribution.
For example, http://www.phpbbarabia.com/ as Demo URL concerning the [Arabic language](https://www.phpbb.com/customise/db/translation/arabic/ "Arabic language") is allowed.
